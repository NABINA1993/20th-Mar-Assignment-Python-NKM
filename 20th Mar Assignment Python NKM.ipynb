    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another for efficient storage, processing, and analysis. In data science, data encoding is useful because it enables data to be represented in a way that can be effectively used by machine learning models, statistical algorithms, and other analytical tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different encoding techniques used in data science, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding: This technique is used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors. Each category is represented by a binary vector with a 1 in the position corresponding to the category and 0s in all other positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding: This technique is used to represent categorical variables as numerical values. Each category is assigned a unique integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary encoding: This technique is used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors, but it uses fewer dimensions than one-hot encoding. Each category is represented by a binary vector with a 1 in the position corresponding to the category and 0s in all other positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding: This technique is used to represent ordinal variables as numerical values. Each category is assigned a unique integer value based on its order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing encoding: This technique is used to represent categorical variables as numerical values using a hash function. Each category is assigned a unique integer value based on its hash value.\n",
